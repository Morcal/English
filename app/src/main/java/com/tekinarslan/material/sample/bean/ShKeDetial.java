     AP News Dictation Apr 19 p.m. 2016
     This is AP News Minute
     The two frontrunners in the polls in New York and in their party’s races so far have cast their ballots in today’s New York primary. Hillary Clinton voted with her husband in Chappaqua, New York. While Donald Trump voted at a synagogue near Trump Tower in Manhattan.
     As more than a foot of rain deluged the nation’s fourth-largest city, inundating homes and shutting down major highways and leaving at least five people dead, Houston’s mayor said there was no immediate solution. Flash flooding and a 50% chance of more rain were possible Tuesday; a day after nearly 18 inches fell in 24 hours.
     Four killer whales, including a baby, were trapped in icy water off Sakhalin Island in Russia on Tuesday. Rescuers and locals tried to free them by pushing ice blocks from their path. Three of the whales managed to swim to the open sea, the fourth remains trapped.
     And the force is strong with these two brothers, Prince William and Prince Harry duked it out with light sabers during a visit to the star war set in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday. The royals took a tour of the studio visited with some of the cast and crew of the film series.
